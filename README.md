# GMOD-LegacyParser
A shell script that generates a lua script to facilitate easy legacy addon downloading
## Note
This script was made for the sole intent of being used on some personal servers of mine, meaning that while the current script's flow might seem right for me, it DOESN'T however mean it will work well for another server operator's setup.

Thus because of this motive, this script isn't exactly too user friendly as you need to manually move the generated script to the proper autorun folder inside gmod!
I've tried adding in some checks and parameters that I see other operator's utilizing, however it isn't a fairly deep and there is a high chance that **errors and bugs will occur**.
